### Lecture 3 - Lies, Damned Lies and Statistics (about TEDTalks)
**Reference:** [Lies, Damned Lies and Statistics (about TEDTalks)](https://www.ted.com/talks/lies_damned_lies_and_statistics_about_tedtalks#t-316284)

The third lecture is a presentation about the insights gotten from a TED Talks data analysis.

After watching the video...
- What do you think about the visualisations that the speaker used to present his insights? Which one is your favorite?
I think it's nice to use drawing type visualizations, especially for this type of talk  which is on a subject that is not too serious.
My preferred one is the one where he presents the graph about the length a talk should be in order to be successfull as a function of the subject of the talk. 

- What's your opinion about the speech? Did he get his point across?
Yes he did get his point across. He presented the data and the resultsin a funny way but in a very understandable manner.

- Was the presentation about a trascendental topic? Did it keep you glued to the screen?
No it wasn't a transcendental subject but it was a very interesting one. I really liked the insights he gave about how to make a successfull TED talk.

- Is there anything you think the speaker missed, something he could improve or do yo have some to-do ideas for him?
No I think he covered all the various topics.
