- What do you think about the visualizations that the speaker used to present his insights? Which one is your favorite?

The visualizations were good; I like how simple they were.

My favorite visualizations were:
		The range of topics that you can choose for your tedtalk (Correlation with viewers will react to your talk)
		The tedpad, even though it was very small and unclear, I liked the idea and how it all connected together and of course I went to the URL :D



- What's your opinion about the speech? Did he get his point across?

I liked the talk, and I also liked the fact that it was very precise, he managed to talk about a lot of things, such as (Topic, Delivery, and Visuals), and he got his point across in few minutes.



- Was the presentation about a transcendental topic? Did it keep you glued to the screen?

I enjoyed the topic and the way he presented it and I liked the fact the he was throwing in some funny probes related to the topic, to keep the audience engaged and feel warmer towards him and more receptive to the talk.

The video was not that long, but yes, I finished the video in one go, because he was keeping me engaged because I enjoyed that he used some statistics about different things from the TedTalks website, such as the amount of words, ratings, and number of videos. And that I can also relate to his findings, because it makes sense that the most favorite talks are those that we can relate with, like happiness, psychology and food, because people often become uninterested if they do not understand a technical topic, like architecture and materials.



- Is there anything you think the speaker missed, something he could improve or do you have some to-do ideas for him?

To be honest I couldn't think of any things to improve about the talk, because I really like how he was precise and managed to get his point across and explain various things in less than 6 minutes.
