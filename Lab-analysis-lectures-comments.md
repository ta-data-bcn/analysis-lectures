Lecture 3 - Lies, Damned Lies and Statistics (about TEDTalks)

What do you think about the visualisations that the speaker used to present his insights? Which one is your favorite?
Most of the visualisations were pretty clear. The top 10 words is my favorite. Simple, understandable.

What's your opinion about the speech?
That was funny, short and clear.

Did he get his point across?
If his point was that we have to say the things that people want to hear and show them what they want to see, yes.

Was the presentation about a trascendental topic?
Not really, nothing new.

Did it keep you glued to the screen?
Yes.

Is there anything you think the speaker missed, something he could improve or do yo have some to-do ideas for him?
More pie charts. Pie is good for lambda people (FREE FOOD)
