# Lab | Analysis Lectures

## Introduction
The goal of this lab is for you to read real data analytics projects and give some feedback on them. 

## Getting started
Choose **one** of the lectures below and try to give your opinion about it, as well as answer the proposed questions. 

Feel free to read all of them and make some comments if you are interested!

## Lectures
### Lecture 1 - A Brief Exploration of Baseball Statistics
**Reference:** [A Brief Exploration of Baseball Statistics](https://medium.com/@williamkoehrsen/data-analysis-with-python-19434f5d6324)

The first lecture is related to finding a relation between certain baseball statistics and the players salary.

**Only read it until the T-test part!**

Pay attention to how the author began his analysis: 
- He defined his goal.
- He asked himself some questions.
- He formed some perfectly defined hypotheses.
- He studied the raw data and made some decisions based on what he saw. 
- He checked that his code worked as intended by examining his dataframes. 
- He knew exactly which visualizations he would need to try to answer his questions. 

Think about the process you've been following during your current project. 
- Is it similar to what the author of the article did?
- What do you think you can improve in your next project by reading how the author planned his analysis? 
- Is there anything you think the author missed, something he could improve or do yo have some to-do ideas for him?

**Comments**

I think the most important factor that made the analysis this precise is the expertise and the familiarity that the author has with the subject at hand, which helps in eliminating preconceptions that a less informed analyst may have and makes the process of interpreting data much easier. This also shows in the hypothesis that were made and the usage of attributes such as "Earned Runs" which a non-basketball fan has probably never head about. The methodology and the process was extremely less chaotic than the one we used and I believe is mostly because of the difference in the amount of time of care given to the planning of the project. I'll surely dedicate more time to planning my next one.

I mostly agree with all the points made by the author but personally I would have tried to include the effect that player popularity can have on their salary e.g. two player can have very similar stats but the one with a higher social presence and fans means more ticket and merchandise sales for their franchise.

### Lecture 2 - I was looking for a house, so I built a web scraper in Python!
**Reference:** [I was looking for a house, so I built a web scraper in Python!](https://towardsdatascience.com/looking-for-a-house-build-a-web-scraper-to-help-you-5ab25badc83e)

The second lecture is related to scraping the data from a real state website. 

After reading the article...
- Try to access the *robots.txt* file of [Giphy](https://giphy.com) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com) as explained in the article. Can you scrape those web pages? Do some research and try to understand those files. 
- Did you do some web scraping in your project? Did you have to use some of the *tricks* the author used regarding time sleep, user-agent, ...? Why? Explain your experience. 
- Is there anything you think the author missed, something he could improve or do yo have some to-do ideas for him?

Since I have not used web scraping in my project I find the concept very interesting and I appreciated the chance of seeing actual webscraping code, including the Beautiful Soup library. I do believe that some code could have been made more efficient, especially using a RegEx instead of a replace AND itertools just to scrape the price withou any special symbols. I liked the sleep and useragent tricks to avoid being timed out by the server.

### Lecture 3 - Lies, Damned Lies and Statistics (about TEDTalks)
**Reference:** [Lies, Damned Lies and Statistics (about TEDTalks)](https://www.ted.com/talks/lies_damned_lies_and_statistics_about_tedtalks#t-316284)

The third lecture is a presentation about the insights gotten from a TED Talks data analysis.

After watching the video...
- What do you think about the visualisations that the speaker used to present his insights? Which one is your favorite?
- What's your opinion about the speech? Did he get his point across?
- Was the presentation about a trascendental topic? Did it keep you glued to the screen?
- Is there anything you think the speaker missed, something he could improve or do yo have some to-do ideas for him?

Given that the speech is mostly a joke, even though the data used and the analysis of it is legit, I still didn't find it interesting, both for a lack of interest in the subject (not a fan of TED talks in general) and a general lack of charisma from the speaker. I did enjoy the graph showing a relation between the popularity of a ted talk and the duratin of it, but I would have liked to actually see the data sources.

## Deliverables
- Markdown file with your comments about the lecture.

## Submission
Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
