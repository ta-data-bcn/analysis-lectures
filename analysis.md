# Jaume Vicens - Analysis Lectures Lab
#### What do you think about the visualisations that the speaker used to present his insights? Which one is your favorite?
He showed very straightforward and visual visualtisations, highlighting the points of what he was mentioning to attract the attention of what you see to his actual content.
My favourite one is the one regarding right duration of the TedTalk, which shows a graph of the best/worst valued and their duration. 
I also liked that he tried to define in four variables the type of speech.

#### What's your opinion about the speech? Did he get his point across?
I did like the speech, very well organized. He started with the goal of his study and framed it into different levels of analysis, and he finished not only with an answer to that goal but also a tool (output) so others could get advantage of that work.

#### Was the presentation about a trascendental topic? Did it keep you glued to the screen?
The topic was not itself transcendental, but it did use the trasncendency of the topics of other TEDTalks to get useful and practical output for an audience that is very related/connected to that topic (TEDTalks). He did keep me glued to the screen as I could feel related or interested on what he was saying, and he merged that talk into only 5 minutes, with no time to disconnect or get bored from it.

#### Is there anything you think the speaker missed, something he could improve or do yo have some to-do ideas for him?
As the rythm is very fast, I was not able to get more details about his insights. He showed data but did not prove enough how did he get to that conclusion or showed specific results (like real numbers) to prove that. 
The pace is fast, which makes it dynamic and fun, but I had the feeling I just had to believe everything he says no matter the real results of the data analysis.
