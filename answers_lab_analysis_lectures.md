## Video 3: TEDxTalk

### Questions and Answers:
- What do you think about the visualisations that the speaker used to present his insights? Which one is your favorite?
I really enjoyed the visualizations he did. They were clear and insightful. In my case, my favorite visualization was the one according to the time you should be on the stage if you want to have a brilliant tedtalk. However, as he says, the tip here is that try to be on the stage as much a you can. 

- What's your opinion about the speech? Did he get his point across?
I think the speech was so nice and clear. He presented in a funny way the lies and the incoherent fact that can be approved or determined by means of statistics. In a very particular way, he tries to say that statistics can be applied everywhere, but not on everywhere they make sense. However, I have been able to learn how to visualize some results and attrack the attention of the audience using such a complicated topic as statistics. He also uses a topic where all the audience can feel like part of it. 

- Was the presentation about a trascendental topic? Did it keep you glued to the screen?
No, absolutely not. He used a topic from our daily lives and that we all have heard about. However, it kept me glued to the screen because he is so funny and the slides were so nice. 


- Is there anything you think the speaker missed, something he could improve or do yo have some to-do ideas for him?
I would also gave some insights about what NOT to do if we don't want a really bad Tedtalk. He kind of went over it but not it detail. Details about the words, the topics, and also the background slides' color should have been nice to listen to. A part from that, I don't have anything else to say. It was so great!!
